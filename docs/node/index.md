## Running locally

### With Docker

We are making available a simple Docker-based set up with Hyperledger Besu so you can try out locally Keccak mining.
The local network has a very small fixed difficulty as well so you can easily produce blocks on your machine with CPU mining.

`$> docker run -p 8545:8545 tmio/besu-keccak --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=admin,eth,debug,miner,net,txpool,priv,trace,web3 --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --network=ecip1049_dev --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase=fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73`

### With Docker Compose

You can [download this Docker Compose file](https://github.com/antsankov/astor-network/blob/master/docs/node/docker-compose.yml) and automate away the set up of a simple Besu with a bundled Python CPU miner. You can use the Python miner as a starting point for optimized mining approaches/hardware.

Download the file and make sure Docker Compose is installed.

To run, make a new directory, and get the docker compose:

`$> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antsankov/astor-network/master/docs/node/docker-compose.yml` 

and then run

`$> docker-compose up`

It will run interactively the set up and collaboration of Besu with the CPU miner.

You can exit with Ctrl+C.

## Mining locally

If you would like to mine on the network, you will need to install a miner to connect to Besu (see below).

You will need to enable Besu's stratum mining as well:

1. `$> docker run -p 8545:8545 tmio/besu-keccak --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=admin,eth,debug,miner,net,txpool,priv,trace,web3 --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --network=ecip1049_dev --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase=fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73
  --miner-stratum-enabled --miner-stratum-host=0.0.0.0`


1. Connect Metamask to `localhost:8545`

The dev network uses 3 accounts. Here are the private keys:
* `8f2a55949038a9610f50fb23b5883af3b4ecb3c3bb792cbcefbd1542c692be63`
* `c87509a1c067bbde78beb793e6fa76530b6382a4c0241e5e4a9ec0a0f44dc0d3`
* `ae6ae8e5ccbfb04590405997ee2d52d2b330726137b875053c36d94e974d162f`

You can import them into Metamask.

## Mining Client (EXPERIMENTAL)

Currently, we have only created a CPU miner in Python, however we will be working on an open source GPU version as well. Please consult [our resources](/mine/) if you are interested in mining.

`$> git clone https://github.com/snissn/ethereum-cpu-miner.git`

`$> pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`$> sh run.sh`

Make sure to change the `run.sh` to have the `-n` be the number of blocks you want to mine on the testnet. Screenshot below is succesful testnet mine to the author address.

## More difficulty

The dev network uses a fixed, small difficulty so it uses CPU mining by default.
You can provide a different genesis file with the following approach:
1. mount a different genesis file
1. change the arguments to pick it up.

Here is an example of genesis file:
```
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": 2021,
    "ecip1049Block": 0,
    "keccak256": {

      "balance": "90000000000000000000000"
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Genesis Example 

`$> docker run -p 8545:8545 -v genesis.json:/tmp/genesis.json tmio/besu-keccak --rpc-http-enabled --rpc-http-api=admin,eth,debug,miner,net,txpool,priv,trace,web3 --rpc-http-cors-origins="all"  --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase=fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73 --genesis-file=/tmp/genesis.json`
